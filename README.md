## Assignment 2
This project is a basic JavaScript-based website that provides three utilities for user input processing: string reversal, palindrome checking, and tip calculation. The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (without jQuery).

## Project Structure
index.html - Contains the webpage structure with sections for each task.
style.css - Provides basic styling for the page.
index.js - Contains JavaScript functions for handling user inputs, validating data, and displaying results.

## Functionalities
### Reverse String
Prompts the user to enter a string and displays the reversed result.
Validates for non-empty input and displays an error if the input is invalid.

### Palindrome Checker
Prompts the user to enter a numeric string and checks if itâ€™s a palindrome.
Validates that the input contains only numbers and displays an error for invalid input.

### Tip Calculator
Prompts the user to enter a bill subtotal and tip percentage, then calculates the total amount including the tip.
Validates inputs as positive numbers and displays an error for invalid input.
Usage

### Open index.html in a web browser.
Use each section by entering the appropriate input and clicking the button to see the results.
If the input is invalid, an error message will be shown.
